# Seq2Seq-Deep-learning-model-for-Text-annotation
This Project is about text annotation regarding the feeling extracting from micro text clip
In this project we are trying to handle a micro text processing task using deep leanring sequential model(LSTM) with word representation model like Word2vec to infer the feeling from the micro text
This benchmark model works very fine (with high accuracy) +80% only for few epochs (due to hardware limitation in our case :) ). But this model could invested in many different text areas like tweets, short news, facebook comments and posts, micro blogs and finally Amazone product reviews etc..
This model is now under using to analyze and measure the student satisfaction toward teaching, exams, and university life in Italy.
